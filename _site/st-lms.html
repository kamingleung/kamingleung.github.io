	<h1>Scholar Tree LMS</h1>
	<h3>My role</h3>
	<p>
		<b>UX Design, User Research, UI Visual Design, Front-end Development</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		As the UX designer of EIC’s tech team, I led the full end-to-end product design process for the LMS between May to Dec 2017. I made detailed research on users and business needs and constantly validate them as I create user flows to prototype. I have also created the UI visual design and took part in front-end development.
	</p>
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>
		Scholar Tree Learning Management System is an all around online platform that records and organizes all student academic data that are shared between teachers, staff, students and parents.
	</p>
	<h3>Goal</h3>
	<p>
		Keeping track of records of every student is a very tedious and time-consuming process. Currently, Scholar Tree’s operation relies on bookkeeping with Excel spreadsheets which leads to mistakes and miscommunications. The goal of the LMS is the provide automated processes that can accelerate teaching experience and operating performance.
	</p>
	<h2>Process</h2>
	<h3><b>Phase 1: THINK</b></h3>
	<h3>Interview</h3>
	<div class="photobox highlight">
		<img src="/assets/img/st-lms/interview.jpg">
		<p class="cpation">As I interview the campuses at Scholar Tree, I took detailed notes and gathered samples of teaching materials to understand their daily operation. Materials such as student’s handbook and reports are great resources for building a digital grade book in the LMS.</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		The stakeholders has the most idea on what this project is all about. I Interviewed teachers and principle and staff to establish their objectives and goals for creating the LMS. Speaking with them helped me to understand their workflow and identify their pain points they face everyday at the campuses. Our product manager and I spent a few days at the campus attending sample classes and shadow behind staff to get a feel of how the school operates
	</p>
	<h3>Identify users and personas</h3>
	<div class="photobox hightlight">
		<img src="/assets/img/st-lms/personas.jpg">
	</div>
	<p>
		I categorized information from the interview and teaching materials, then established the types of users who would use the system. The information gathered from interviews also help shape personas for in-depth scope of each user type.
	</p>
	<h3>Discover thru journey mapping</h3>
	<div class="photobox hightlight">
		<img src="/assets/img/st-lms/classroom-journey.jpg">
		<p class="cpation">An example of an user journey of teachers running a classroom in Scholar Tree.</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		Using the interviews and personas, I created journey maps to detail how personas would go through their existing workflow. These maps allow the team to understand user’s feelings and identify any opportunities when creating our new workflow.
	</p>
	<h3>Discover thru scenario mapping</h3>
	<p>
		With the existing user journeys mapped out, I invited members of our Project development and engineering team to create new workflows for the LMS. We picked a few major scenarios for each user type and started brainstorming with user’s perspective and concerns that we have learned from journey maps.
	</p>
	<h3>Define user stories</h3>
	<p>
		I invited our team again to identified the most common user stories for the first version’s MVP. We also save other ideas into a backlog for later iterations.
	</p>
	<h3>Define sitemap</h3>
	<div class="photobox hightlight">
		<img src="/assets/img/st-lms/lms-sitemap.jpg">
	</div>
	<p>
		I began creating the sitemap based on how users will navigate and need what kinds of content to complete their user journeys.
	</p>
	<h3>User flow</h3>
	<p>
		Align with Engineering and product manager to check with technical aspect of the project, I created a more detailed user flow that documents the different possible states that the user goes through to reach the goal. For a large project like the LMS, I create separate user flows for each user story, so that I can focus on specific steps.

	<h3><b>Phase 2: CREATE</b></h3>
	<h3>Wireframe</h3>

			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>
		I created my wireframes with Balsamiq. I found it really easy to generate interface design quickly, especially when using sets of UI components from our <a href="/global-asset.html">design system (see my case study).</a> The point my wireframes is to be able to convey the ideas to stakeholders using the least amount of time. My wireframes are then linked together using Marvel to create an interactive prototypes for early user testing. They can be easily generated and shared for users to try.
	</p>
	<h3>HD design on HTML</h3>
	<p>
		As I refine and validate our design, we felt confident to build the design into code. Going from wireframe to code may sound like a huge jump, but by using our design system, the wireframes can easily be transformed into code using existing components.
